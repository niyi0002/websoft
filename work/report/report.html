<p>* Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</p>
<p> Yes, I knew about the GitHub before. I have used in my previous courses. But I have not used the Markdown before taking this course. This is the first time I experience creating/working with websites.</p>

<p> No, I have never created a website before. </p> 
<p>* Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</p>
<p>I had no experience or knowledge about web development before.</p>  
<p>* What is your TIL for this course section?</p> 
<p>Thanks to assignment I have learned how to fork a repository on GitHub which I have not done before. I also learned how to link to an another page of my website which I thought was really fun and pretty simple to do.</p>
